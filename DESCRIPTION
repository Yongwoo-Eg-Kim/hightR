Description: HIGHT(HIGh security and light weigHT) algorithm is a block cipher encryption algorithm developed to provide confidentiality in computing environments that demand low power consumption and lightweight, such as RFID(Radio-Frequency Identification) and USN(Ubiquitous Sensor Network), or in mobile environments that require low power consumption and lightweight, such as smartphones and smart cards. It is specially designed for portable devices and mobile environments and developed to consume less power. Additionally, it is designed with a simple structure that enables it to be used with basic arithmetic operations, XOR, and circular shifts in 8-bit units. This algorithm was designed to consider both safety and efficiency in a very simple structure suitable for limited environments, compared to the former 128-bit encryption algorithm SEED. Unlike conventional block cipher algorithms, This algorithm removes the S-Box (Substitution-box), making it suitable for environments with limited hardware resources, such as memory. In December 2006, it was standardized by the telecommunications industry, and in December 2010, it became an ISO(International Organization for Standardization) standard. The detailed procedure is described in Hong et al. (2006) <doi:10.1007/11894063_4>.
