Description: Encryption and decryption using HIGHT(HIGh security and light weigHT) algorithm. HIGHT is a block cipher encryption algorithm developed to provide confidentiality in computing environments that demand low power consumption and lightweight, such as RFID and USN, or in mobile environments that require low power consumption and lightweight, such as smartphones, smart cards, and RFID. It is specially designed for portable devices and mobile environments and developed to consume less power. Additionally, it is designed with a simple structure that enables it to be used with basic arithmetic operations, XOR, and circular shifts in 8-bit units. HIGHT was designed to consider both safety and efficiency in a very simple structure suitable for limited environments, compared to the former 128-bit encryption algorithm SEED. Unlike conventional block cipher algorithms, HIGHT removes the S-Box (Substitution-box), making it suitable for environments with limited hardware resources, such as memory. In December 2006, it was standardized by the telecommunications industry, and in December 2010, it became an ISO/IEC international standard.
